Forgive me now, for all the words I said
Forgive me now, for all the things I made
Forgive me (Forgive me now), for all the words I said
(Forgive me)
Forgive me now, I hope it's not too late
Too late

I am waiting for any reaction
Tell me what changed my mind
Don't know what it is, don't know what you'll find
Maybe it's my own imagination
That turns the friendly card inside
I've no answer but I feel it's time to say

Forgive me now, for all the words I said
Forgive me (Forgive me now), for all the things I made
Forgive me now (Forgive me), for all the things I made
Believe me now, I hope it's not too late
Too late...

Forgive me now, for all the words I said
For all the words, for all the words I said
Forgive me now (Forgive me), forgive me, forgive me now

Forgive me now (Forgive me now), for all the words I said
(Forgive me)
Forgive me now, for all the things I made
Forgive me (Forgive me now), for all the words I said
Believe me now, I hope it's not too late
Too late

Too late

Forgive me, forgive me now
For all the words, for all the words I said

Forgive me
Forgive me now
