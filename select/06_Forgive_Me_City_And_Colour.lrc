[00:41.31] I'll cross my heart and hope to die
[00:47.79] Before I'd have the chance to lie
[00:54.38] To you, my dear, who I wish no harm
[01:01.01] But I know in the end this will turn out wrong
[01:07.79] See I've been known to fall in love
[01:14.29] But sometimes love just is not enough
[01:21.07] And my heart will stray before too long
[01:27.79] So please forgive me for when I sing this song
[01:39.39] Oooh
[01:46.14] Oooh
[01:52.70] Oooh
[01:59.55] Oooh
