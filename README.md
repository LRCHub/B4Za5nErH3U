# ちゃんみな – FORGIVE ME

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Do I make you nauseous
Do I make you shy
Are you mad I got options
Does it make you cry
When I talk I'mma say what I say what I want
When I wanna do I'mma do what I want
Brrr, they call from Paris, fuck it I'll wear it
I could make a check from my walk
Woo I'm just exactly, I'm just
Who you say I am
Of course I'm a bad bitch, can you forgive me
I'm with your favorite idol can you forgive me
And If I kiss her, tell me can you forgive me
Can you forgive me
Diamonds on my wrist, can you forgive me
Didn't pay for what you see in my bikini
And I don't even give a fuck if you forgive me
Please forgive me
わかるわかるその気持ちも
中指立てて逃げるのも
私みたいな有名人はもうこう
あるべきとか言っちゃうのも
だって私headline
理解できるからalright
君は好きなだけ言いなよall day all night
Woo I don't care what you say, no
Woo what about you?
Of course I'm a bad bitch, can you forgive me
I'm with your favorite idol, can you forgive me
And If I kiss her, tell me can you forgive me
Can you forgive me
Diamonds on my wrist, can you forgive me
Didn't pay for what see in my bikini
And I don't even give a fuck if you forgive me
Please forgive me
Can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me
